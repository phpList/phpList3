### For developers

How to upgrade from any previous version to the latest version

Step 1. BACKUP your database
(e.g. # mysqldump -u[user] -p[password] [database] > phplist-backup.sql)

Step 2. Copy your old configured files to some safe place

These files are:
	lists/config/config.php
        possibly lists/texts/english.inc or any other language.inc if you have edited it

Step 3. Copy the files from the tar file to your webroot.

You can copy everything in the "lists" directory in the tar file to your website.
To facilitate future upgrades, ie to make it easier for you to simply copy
everything I have now put the "configurable" files in their own directory. They
reside in "lists/config". This is hopefully going to be the directory thay you can
keep between upgrades, and that will contain the only information that you want
changed in order to make it work for your own site.

Step 4. Copy your configuration files to lists/config or re-edit the new config file
sometimes new features are added to the config file, so it's better to use
the new config file and re-adapt it to your situation.

I have put an example .htaccess file in this directory. You should not allow
access to this directory from the webserver at all. The example will work with
apache.

You can overwrite the files that are there. They are example files.

Step 5. Go to http://yourdomain/lists/admin/ and choose the Upgrade link

Step 6. Click the link in this page.

This process may take quite a while if your database is large. Don't interrupt it.

## Issues

Report issues to [Mantis issue tracker](https://mantis.phplist.org/bug_report_page.php) (select project *phpList*)

## Languages
In the directory `phplists/lists/texts` you will find existing translations of the public
pages of phpList. You can use them in your config file to make the frontend of the system
appear in the language of your choice.

In the config file there are a lot of choices to make about your particular
installation. Make sure to read it carefully and step by step work your way through
it. A lot of information is provided with each step.
