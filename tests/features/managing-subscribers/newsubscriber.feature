Feature: Create a new subscriber
  In order to create a new subscriber
  As an admin user
  I need to be able to login and start a new campaign

  Scenario: Login and create a campaign
    Given I have logged in as an administrator
  # Then I should see "Add a new subscriber"
  # When I follow "Add a new subscriber"
  # Then I should see "Email address"
  # When I fill in "email" with an email address
  # And I press "change"
  # Then I should see "subscriber profile"
  # Then print last response
  # this fails, even though the address is there
  # And I should see the email address I entered
  # And I follow "History"
  # Then I should see the email address I entered
